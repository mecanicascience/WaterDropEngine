## Presentation
WaterDropEngine (<i>WDE</i>) is a 3D rendering engine in Rust based on the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) engine, based on the WebGPU api.

<br/>

## Running the engine
To start running WaterDropEngine, you will need to have Rust installed on your computer. If you don't have it, you can install it by following the instructions on the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Then, you'll need to fork the project into your own GitHub account, clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/mecanicascience/WaterDropEngine.git`.

Once all of these is done, you are ready to start using WaterDropEngine!
If you use `Visual Studio Code`, you can open the current repository by running `code .` in the terminal in the root of the project. Then 4 different running configurations are available:
- `Trace` to run in debug mode with tracing enabled. You can then download [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) to visualize the traces.
- `Debug` to run in debug mode without tracing.
- `Release` to publish the game in release mode.
- `Generate Docs` to generate the documentation of the project and open it in your browser.
